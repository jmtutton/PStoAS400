PS_ZHRT_RFSRC_CREF for Referral Source
ZPS_ZGLT_PT12P_CREF for Legal Branch

TASK_FLAG – values C, P, E and Z
When the trigger record is first inserted it will be ‘P’ and after sending to legacy the status becomes ‘C’
When there is an error, the status will be ‘E’, but now most cases even for E, the status is updated as C and moved as an error routine. ‘Z’ is a dummy row value in the Table.
