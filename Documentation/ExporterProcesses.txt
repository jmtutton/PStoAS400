ZHRI100a.sqr – This SQR runs looking for any Triger data and invokes the Call to the Legacy Libraries and updates the Legacy Files. There is a sleep time of 15 seconds between each call.
For ZHRI101a (Hire) and ZHRI106a (Rehire) Procedures, the where condition of the main SQL in the procedure ‘Get-Trigger-Data’ has been setup in a way that the SEQ NBR is greater for them and these records(any hire/rehire) gets processed first, before any other procedures.
The below SQCs are called from the SQR

1.	HR01-Process-Main – Called from ZHRI100a SQR, calls zhri100a.sqc.
Proc_Name that uses this SQC are - ZHRI101A (hire), ZHRI106A (rehire)

Get-Oprid
The SQR ZHRI100a has the procedure ‘Get-Oprid’, which is called by all the SQCs
This Process actually creates the EID in PSHR from Legacy Systems. Legacy has a master tale HR036P which already contains the EIDs during the hiring in PS.
The proc verifies the emplid in change, is present in the Cross Reference table - PS_ZHRT_EMPID_CREF between PS and Legacy. If the emplid is not present (which usually happens for HIRE/REHIRE), it calls another procedure to pick the emplid (EID/oprid) from the master table - HR036P (this table resides in Legacy System). The procedure also inserts the missing data into the PS_ZHRT_EMPID_CREF table.	
Zhri101a.sqc which is the HIRE process calls this procedure after the command call to Legacy, and all other procedures calls it before the command call.

zbas002b.sh – Triggered from the ZHRI100a SQR 
AS/400 machine name – ELLIB and the remote server - central.corp.erac.com
A successful command will be – (this is for Job Profile Changes- zhri104a for the Oprid – 151BM )
/usr/local/barch/PS90HRPD/scripts/zbas002b.sh "CALL ELLIB/HRZ104A PARM('151BM' '375PC' 'M5' 'N' ' ' 'CC038' 'F' 'A' 'N' 'N' '08212016')" central.corp.erac.com 

Error Handling - 
The Error routine is called whenever there is any error, for example the legacy equivalent is not found.
Also for all the procedures where there is a deletion – ZHRI101D, ZHRI102D, ZHRI104D, ZHRI105D, ZHRI106D, ZHRI107D, ZHRI109D Error routine is called.
The Error message shouldn’t be more than 75 characters
Examples for an error command- for EMPLIDs’ 308508 and 956143 – leading 0s’ removed.

/usr/local/barch/PS90HRPD/scripts/zbas002b.sh "CALL ELLIB/HRZ110A PARM('HRZ104A' '000308508' ' ' 'A row was deleted on the job-profile process

All procedures related to Active Directory (AD) are no longer used as ERD is used instead.

ZHRI110a.sqr – This SQR runs every third Saturday of a month, and cleans the Trigger table - PS_ZHRT_INTTRIGGER.
It will move rows from the Trigger table to the History Table.  It will also delete rows from the history file after they have resided there for one year.
